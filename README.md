# Project Title: Does the “No Free Lunch” theorem apply to standard classifiers run on data and what constitutes a similar dataset?
# Problem Definition:
With AI becoming more prominent in both Industry and Academia, gathering, and analyzing large data sets is becoming more important. 
I will be implementing a web scraper that will download open-source data to be used by AI models. Furthermore, I will be evaluating 
said collected data against standard classifiers to determine their fitness. To create a predictive AI for the best classifiers that 
can be applied to a set of data. Thus, providing evidence to what “Similar” from the “No Free Lunch” theorem refers to.
